The rule score is a heuristic score that takes into account: (1) the number of co-occurrences between hepatobiliary terms and adverse effect terms in a sentences, (2) their respective relative order within the sentence and (3) their relative distance measured by the number of word tokens between them<br/>

                               Compound, Cytochrome and Marker mentions can be curated at the sentence level from the results table. The curation process consists in confirming (checbox) or denying (crossbox) the association between that entity and the hepatotoxic effect inside the sentence. A total number is associated to that relation in the way that checkbox will add (+1) to the total count while crossbox will sustract (-1) to the total count.
